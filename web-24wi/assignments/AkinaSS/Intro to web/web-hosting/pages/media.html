              <p id="hiddenText" class="more-read lead">The Chainsmokers were initially made up of Pall and former DJ Rhett Bixler. 
                The Chainsmokers were re-formed as an EDM DJ duo in 2012 under the management of Adam Alpert in New York City. <br></br>
                In April 2013, the Chainsmokers released a remix of "Medicine" by Daughter and it reached number 1 on HypeMachine. <br></br>
                The duo started out by making remixes of indie bands. In 2012, they collaborated with Indian actress and recording artist Priyanka Chopra on the single "Erase" which was followed by "The Rookie" in early 2013. <br></br>
                In an interview during the Upfront Summit 2023, Alex Pall stated that the name "Chainsmokers" was a provisional based on the fact that he used to smoke a lot of cigarettes and they needed only one name for promotional flyers.

                The Chainsmokers began teasing their eventual return after completing their fourth studio album, occasionally breaking their social media fast to post promotional material for the upcoming album and reiterate that they were continuously working on the project. <br></br>
                On July 14, 2020, after having largely isolated themselves since the social media hiatus and the COVID-19 pandemic, the duo announced plans to hold a "drive-in" charity concert, "Safe & Sound", on July 25, as their first in-person concert since January 2020 prior to Super Bowl LIV. 
                The concert was presented by Jerry Media's Tequila brand JAJA, which is co-owned by the Chainsmokers. 
                The concert was stated to be a "socially-distanced drive-in show to benefit the charities No Kid Hungry, Southampton Fresh Air Home, and the Children's Medical Fund of New York" and was meant to be a future example of COVID-19 pandemic concert audience safety. 
                On July 25, 2020, the Chainsmokers and Goldman Sachs' CEO, David Solomon, who produces EDM under the stage name DJ D-Sol, headlined the charity concert in Southampton, New York.
