## Notes:
Wrote all code from https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/wiki/SC%E2%80%9024sp%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9004%E2%80%9008%E2%80%90Afternoon <br>

```Cargo build``` has errors. Need to work through the errors. This version is missing local Vscode dependencies.<br>

To create the file locally ```Cargo new tictactoe``` , then the additational rust dependencies will get generated within the file structure.<br>

Messed mine ups! Typed out a working copy form the class repo. Was able to build and run.

Started modifying the game. I am trying to use the logic that the Ai uses to determine how to block me and provide an instance where the player can request assistance and the Ai will ```suggest``` a move. This, I think, I will be calling the ```find_best_moves``` and comparing with ```find_threating_moves```, also I will have to create some other logic...<br>

## 4/30/2024

Once the player moves, the Ai moves. On the player's next move an option becomes available named ```suggest```, the player can enter for assitance. The ```suggest``` option will provide the player a move choice the player can enter.
