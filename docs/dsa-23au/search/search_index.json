Some students in the program have already studied data structures (DS &amp; A). Those students will be creating their own curriculum in groups. For students who want to learn DS &amp; A, the program syllabus will look like this:         </p> <p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms;</li> <li>Team programming projects (with ChangeMakers)</li> <li>Synthesis of real-world problems with software modeling</li> <li>Software Engineering</li> </ul> </p> <p>         As computer science students, you will deepen your technical knowledge and skills required to understand, analyze, modify, and build complex software systems. The concepts and skills from Data Structures and Algorithms are key for software engineering and programming. Through this program you will also deepen your understanding of computing systems, both in theory and practice. The work will provide prerequisite knowledge for Evergreen's advanced computer science programs.\u00a0         </p> <p>         Working on team projects is very important for almost any job, especially in computer science. Also, at Evergreen we expect students to take charge of their learning. We make this easier by providing\u00a0 a caring and safe innovative team environment. This is ideal for those looking for a practical, hands-on approach to learning. This radically different pathway gives students the opportunity to set-up and run their own projects and ventures. Inspired by the pioneering Finnish \u2018Tiimiakatemia\u2019 approach, we designed this program collaboratively with the ChangeMaker Lab, which was the first to introduce this approach in the United States. The Tiimiakatemia ChangeMaker Lab is accredited by Tiimiakatemia Global\u00ae.         </p> <p>         In the first few weeks you will form a Team Company of up to 20 students, and work on real projects and research the programming, software engineering, and theoretical\u00a0 skills needed for those projects. You will gain entrepreneurial experience and learn how to operate and run an organization as a Holacratic structure. As a Team Entrepreneur, you\u2019ll work with your team in your own office environment virtually or in the classroom in our innovative open office space.\u00a0 You will create and manage projects around your passions, attend directors' meetings. You will have the opportunity to learn the auxiliary skills to manage budgets and build valuable contacts and networks.\u00a0         </p> <p>         You will learn by doing and specifically develop the following job skills: Self\u2010leadership skills, Project leading skills, Planning skills, Team Coaching skills, Strategic skills, Team leadership skills, Service, negotiation and selling skills, Understanding of financial issues, Marketing skills, Innovation skills, Team leadership skills, Data processing and IT \u2013skills, Team Learning skills, Creativity skills, International skills and Communication skills and work on developing Initiative, Courage to make choices and goal orientation.         </p> <p>         This full-time daytime program will be taught on the Olympia campus. Students who need to participate fully remotely should contact the faculty to discuss that option.         </p> <p>         Computer technology has an impact on almost anything we do, and data structures and algorithms are central to advanced study in computer science and to building large complex systems. When applying for positions such as Software Developer or Software Engineer, you will probably find that this program is the most important in helping you prepare for job interviews. In this program, you\u2019ll learn about ways to organize data (we\u2019ll see various data structures such as Lists, Trees, Graphs), ways to compare algorithms (we\u2019ll focus on space and time complexity using big Oh) and efficiently solve programming problems. It will also give you a chance to practice object-oriented and functional programming.         </p> <p>         We are so excited to work with all of you in this awesome program.         </p> <p>         We expect everyone to attend in person, unless you contact us to make alternative arrangements.         </p> Class Meeting Times <p>Monday</p> <p>Tuesday</p> <p>Wednesday</p> <p>Thursday</p> <p>Friday</p> 10am-1pm <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>Systems and Teams</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 12noon-1pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Forest Walk</p> <p></p> <p>&amp;nbps;</p> <p></p> <p>break</p> <p></p> <p>tutoring</p> <p></p> 1-3pm <p>Cracking the Coding Interview / Software Engineering</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3-5pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Textbooks:</p> <p>Required</p> <ul> <li>The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd edition, by Steven Skiena ()</li> <li>Cracking the Coding Interview \u2013 189 programming questions and solutions, Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 6th edition (CCI)ISBN-13: 978-0984782857 </li> </ul> <p>Optional</p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 3rd or 4th edition, by Mark Allen Weiss</li> <li>Dive into Systems (DIS)\u00a0 Dive Into Systems Text: https://diveintosystems.org/development/antora/diveintosystems/1.0/index.html</li> <li>Parallel computing for Beginners https://www.learnpdc.org/PDCBeginners2e/</li> </ul> Concrete Examples Synthesis / Lateral Thinking Week 1 <p>A Self-Guided Tour</p> <p>RAM Model, Lists</p> <p>Arrays, Links, Counters</p> <p>Interfaces, CRUD Operations</p> <p>IntelliJ and Git: practice and warmup</p> <p>Pair Programming: what roles? what rules?</p> <p>Learning Log, ChatGPT / AI prompting</p> <p>ChangeMaker teams, learning together</p> Week 2 <p>Implementation vs. Interfaces</p> <p>Stacks, Queues</p> <p>Key-Value Maps, Hashing</p> <p>Collisions, Links</p> <p>Time-Space and Other Dualities, Resources</p> <p>How to trade off time for space, vice versa?</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Counting and visualizing resources: VisualVM</p> Week 3 <p>Asymptotic Analysis (Big O)</p> <p>Trees, Relations, Searching</p> <p>Traversals: Bread-first, Depth-First</p> <p>Heaps (Priority Queues)</p> <p>Recursion and Iteration</p> <p>Cleaning Up: Invariants, Rebalancing</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Overview of Final Project: Problem-Finding</p> Week 4 <p>Rebalancing Trees</p> <p>Red-Black Trees</p> <p>Rebalancing Heaps</p> <p>Inventing New Data Structures</p> <p>An Exotic Zoo: Fibonacci Forest, Skip Lists</p> <p>Amortized Analysis</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting / Mocking Datasets</p> Week 5 <p>Maximum Subset Sum</p> <p>Dynamic Programming</p> <p>Interval Scheduling</p> <p>Satisficing (Greedy)</p> <p>Subproblems</p> <p>Memoizing / Caching</p> <p>Combining two or more algorithms</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting Datasets</p> Week 6 <p>Graphs</p> <p>Topological Sort, Dependencies</p> <p>Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)</p> <p>Network Flow</p> <p>MapQuest / Google Maps</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Final Project Work: Designing Operations</p> <p>AI proompting and co-pilot: write code</p> Week 7 <p>Sorting, with Heaps and Trees</p> <p>Merge Sort</p> <p>Quicksort</p> <p>Radix Sort</p> <p>Randomized analysis</p> <p>Combining two sorts</p> <p>Joke Sorts: delay as much as possible</p> <p>Art: Pixel sorting</p> Week 8 <p>Database Indexes, Search</p> <p>Page Rank</p> <p>Linear Systems of Equations</p> <p>Constraint Satisfaction</p> <p>Boggle / Scrabble</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> <p>Find linear systems / constraints in real-life</p> <p>Connect DS &amp; A to another discipline</p> Week 9 <p>Karatsuba / Matrix Multiplication</p> <p>Divide and Conquer</p> <p>Streaming Algorithms</p> <p>Parallel Merge Sort</p> <p>Data Privacy</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Parallelize a previous algorithm</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> Week 10 <p>Bonus Topics / Catchup Week</p> <p>Quantum DS &amp; A</p> <p>Recommender Systems</p> <p>Collaborative Filtering</p> <p>Finding Real World Examples: Go Local, Go Deep</p> <p>Final Project Work</p> <p>Synthesizing notes\u00a0</p> Tracks <p> Student who have never taken DSA before will take DSA in this quarter and participate in Changemakers team companies. They may choose either the Java programming language (with examples and support provided by DSA assignments) or any  other programming language where they must provide their own support and collaborate with each other.

No dumbass, spaced repetition is a theory of learning that says if have a structured schedule of learning concepts, you can repeat them again at longer and longer intervals. Every day in the schedule, you can learn something new or repeat a previous concept. At first you repeat it the next day, then in three days, then seven, and so on.. basically forever if you can keep track of it.\"</p> <p>Chadwick muses this. \"Is the schedule different for everyone, or the same?\"</p> <p>\"That's a good question, I don't know.
