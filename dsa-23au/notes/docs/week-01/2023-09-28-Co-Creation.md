Working in teams requires active listening to what one person is saying so that you can repeat back what they said.

One technique is: "I heard you say <blah>, is that right?" and then "This is what I want to contribute to the conversation."

Students who have taken CSF can "speak code," and say "we are going to create this program with these functions and variables to do A, B, and C."

"Speaking code" is a necessary skill for pair programming, which we will use a lot in future quarters.

Sometimes there is confusion, and teammates having a different viewpoint corrects for missing information in conversation.

This class so far is *incredbly* chaotic. I don't belive that I have ever taken a class here at Evergreen that is this level of "all over the place."
Code, and coding has never been my strong suit, but having to do a fair amount of it has been a good refresher. \
Many times, I really feel as if I am totall lost in class, however I'm pretty sure that theres a fair amount of us that feel the same. 
Skills are improving on how to do everthing in a co-created repository, I still worry that I am often doing something wrong.
